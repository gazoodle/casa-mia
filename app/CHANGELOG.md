# Changelog

## 2026.10.3-b1

- Admin UI build tools updated: Vite 8 and the React plugin 6. The panel looks and works the same.
- Admin UI type-checked with TypeScript 7.

## 2026.10.2

- Screenshot swap: the Kiosk Satellite page (proxied) shows the stand-ins in its text too, as it is drawn; its form fields keep the real values.
- Screenshot swap: a dashboard deployed while it is on shows the stand-in names on its camera pages too (their addresses keep the real ones).

- Adding the Casa Mia integration fills in the app's address again: it had stopped finding the app on current Home Assistant (a function it uses had moved), so the field came up empty. Leaving the field empty now also means the app found here.
- The integration setup dialog no longer shows a made-up example address, and a pasted address with a trailing full stop or spaces is accepted.
- The panel's Copy buttons now work in the Home Assistant companion app and say whether the copy worked (they did nothing there before).

## 2026.10.1

- First public release. See the README for what Casa Mia does and how to set it up.
